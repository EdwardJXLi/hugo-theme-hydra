# üê≤ Hydra - Hugo Theme üé®

Highly modified and customized version of the **Hugo theme [cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus)** by **@monkeyWzr**, which is itself a fork from the **Hexo theme [cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus)** created by **@probberechts**.

The primary goal of this fork is to implement a "sub-blog" structure, where multiple topics or "categories" can co-under the same url.

**Before:**
- www.blog.com/posts/aaa
- www.blog.com/posts/bbb
- www.blog.com/posts/ccc

**Now:**
- www.blog.com/tech/aaa
- www.blog.com/tech/bbb
- www.blog.com/art/ccc
- www.blog.com/art/eee
- www.blog.com/music/fff

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This theme differs from the traditional Hugo blog layout! Most likely your existing Hugo content will not render properly. Read more about this below.
